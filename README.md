# SDev-140-Final-Project
This is my final project for Software Development 140. 

I want to make a working Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players can compete against each other. If I can make a game where the computer plays
against the user, even better but I am not holding myself to that expectation. 

I have made a GUI already that brings up one window and then opens to another window, and I will need to use that base code for my project. 
My professor also showed me a command line version of tic-tac-toe, which does work. I have seen other versions of a GUI version of 
tic-tac-toe, but their code didn't function properly. 

I think my next step is to figure out how I can convert a working command line version of a game into a GUI version of it. 
I will need to figure out how to create a visual representation of the board in a window and figure out how to make the entire box of 
each portion of the board one where users can click to indicate where they want to make their next move. Last, I also need to determine
what code I will use to figure out if and when someone has won the game.
