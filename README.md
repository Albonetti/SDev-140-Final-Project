User Manual

This is a graphical user interface of tic-tac-toe. The game opens a first window that contains a welcome message. That window then opens a second window, which gets the users’ names from each other. After the users enter their names, a third window opens to the tic-tac-toe game, and it includes the users’ names in the top of the screen.

The game operates according to the rules of a standard tic-tac-toe game. The first player will be X, and the second player O. The first to move is X, who will choose one square. Then O will choose a square. The players will alternate choosing squares until either X or O has three squares in a row. If all nine squares in the grid fill up without a user earning three in a row, then the game will end with a tie. 

The game is rather straight-forward. Anyone who has played tic-tac-toe and used a computer should know how to operate this game. The second window does require that a person input two names, and those names could be made up of characters or numbers. The window will not allow the user to proceed to the game until the user has entered names for Player 1 and Player 2. 

Good luck, players!





# SDev-140-Final-Project
This is my final project for Software Development 140. 

I want to make a working Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players can compete against each other. If I can make a game where the computer plays
against the user, even better but I am not holding myself to that expectation. 

I have made a GUI already that brings up one window and then opens to another window, and I will need to use that base code for my project. 
My professor also showed me a command line version of tic-tac-toe, which does work. I have seen other versions of a GUI version of 
tic-tac-toe, but their code didn't function properly. 

I think my next step is to figure out how I can convert a working command line version of a game into a GUI version of it. 
I will need to figure out how to create a visual representation of the board in a window and figure out how to make the entire box of 
each portion of the board one where users can click to indicate where they want to make their next move. Last, I also need to determine
what code I will use to figure out if and when someone has won the game.
